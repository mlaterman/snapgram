Optimizations:
	For optimization efforts async package was used when viewing other
		user's feeds as well as photo upload
	stylesheet and thumbnails are cached in lru-caches
	
	a new routing path (/i/) was added - feed by default makes requests
		to this - if it fails to load the thumbnail from the cache and
		can't find the photo in the default (/photos/thumbnail/)
		directory it redirects to /photos/thumnails/ -- this will make a
		db request for the path
	
	Redis is now needed as the backend session manager (intstalled on 
		the local machine); Clustering added, the number of worker
		processes is the CPU count
	
Testing functionality added:
	Mocha framework and should assertions used

Extras:
	Logout option added (get /logout), redirects to login page after
		destroying session
	serving request: get /favicon.ico
