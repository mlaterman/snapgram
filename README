BUGS:
	Occasion duplicate keys when using bulk stream upload does not occur
		on every instance, number changes
		cause: unknown
		Status: one less image visible (not major)
	Null path uploaded with some images pid (only occurs to POST photos/create images)
		cause: unkown
		workaround: feed rendering ignores null paths

Optimizations:
	For optimization efforts async package was used when viewing other
		user's feeds, bulk upload (stream), and thumbnail retrieval
	stylesheet and thumbnails are cached in lru-caches
	
	Redis is now needed as the backend session manager (intstalled on 
		the local machine); Clustering added, the number of worker
		processes is the CPU count
	
Testing functionality added:
	Mocha framework and should assertions used

Extras:
	Logout option added (get /logout), redirects to login page after
		destroying session
	serving request: get /favicon.ico
	
Unimplemented Features:
	share

	minor UI glitch on upload page
