I have noticed that when using the test cript occasionally it takes a
	few seconds for the login function to work. I do not know the cause.

BUGS:
	Occasion duplicate keys when using bulk stream upload does not occur
		on every instance, number changes
		cause: ?
			Does not cause server to break so it is being ignored
			(fixed?)
	Occasional socked hangup on login  - no such table users
		cause : ?
		(fixed?)

Optimizations:
	For optimization efforts async package was used when viewing other
		user's feeds, bulk functions, thumbnail retrieval, and a bit in
		db (addphoto).
	stylesheet and thumbnails are cached in lru-caches
	
	Redis is now needed as the backend session manager (intstalled on 
		the local machine); Clustering added, the number of worker
		processes is the CPU count
	
Testing functionality added:
	Mocha framework and should assertions used

Extras:
	Logout option added (get /logout), redirects to login page after
		destroying session
	serving request: get /favicon.ico
	
Unimplemented Features:
	share
	
Note:
	minor UI glitch on upload page
